    - |-
      I'm a Software Engineer and coding geek from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm passionate about
      Software Architecture and Design, which I often like to include in my posts.

      My background is in Javascript development, but I love exploring and trying out new
      languages. Some of the latest languages I'm playing around with include: Rust, Kotlin and Clojure.
