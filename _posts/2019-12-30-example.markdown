You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

This text has **bold** and _italic_ and _**bold-italic**_ text and [links](http://google.com)

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install save -g nodemon
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight kotlin %}
package com.jfmarino.documentservice.documents.utils

import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils
import org.apache.tika.Tika

// Here is where we do something fun with this function
fun mime(filename: String) : String = Tika().detect(filename)

fun extension(filename: String) : String = FilenameUtils.getExtension(filename)
{% endhighlight %}
